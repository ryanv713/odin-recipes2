    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>The classic Green Tea Shot (also known as a "Jameson Green Tea") is a 
        popular whiskey-based cocktail with peach schnapps. Pretentious mixologists 
        might scoff at the combination of ingredients (and the name) but it's 
        actually an excellent balance of sweet and sour that can be especially 
        refreshing in the summertime. The name comes from its green hue, not its 
        ingredients. So if you're expecting an alcoholic drink with green tea in it, 
        you might be surprised to hear there is no green tea in a Green Tea Shot.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 ounce Irish Whiskey, such as Jameson (15 ml)</li>
        <li>1/2 ounce Peach Schnapps (15 ml)</li>
        <li>1/2 ounce Sour Mix (15 ml)</li>
        <li>Splash of Sprite or other lemon-lime soda</li>
        <li>2 - 4 ice cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the whiskey, peach schnapps, 
            and sour mix in a cocktail shaker with a couple of ice cubes.</li>
        <li>Shake for about 10 seconds to combine all of the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Pour your shot glasses 3/4 full with the green tea shot mixture, 
            using the bar strainer to keep the ice from falling in.</li>
        <li>Top off each shot with the lemon-lime soda.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your green tea shot shortly after it's prepared.</li>
    </ol>
